## about

For me, a colorpicker is the last piece of the puzzle to make Sublime Text 2 a complete
TextMate replacement. Et voil√†!

Source for the colorpick binary can be found at https://github.com/jnordberg/color-pick

## installation

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/Sublime\ Text\ 2/Packages
    git clone git://github.com/jnordberg/sublime-colorpick.git ColorPick

It's important that you check out the repo as ColorPick as the plugin will look for the binary in
`<sublime packages dir>/ColorPick/bin/colorpick`

## usage

`cmd+shift+c` to insert a color

or bind it to a key of your choosing, the command is `color_pick`
