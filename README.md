dotfiles
========

These are my personal dotfiles for my development environment on Mac OS.

Includes configuration files for:
- iTerm
- Sublime Text 2
- Irssi
- bash_profile

Install
-------

Run ```bin/install.sh``` to create backups of existing files and replace with symlinks to the files in this repository. No uninstall exists at the moment (I'll get to it eventually).
