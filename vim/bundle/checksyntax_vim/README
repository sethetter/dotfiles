The checksyntax plugin runs an external syntax checker for the current buffer 
whenever the buffer is saved (by calling the |:CheckSyntax| command). Syntax 
errors are managed as location or quickfix lists. If any syntax error occurs, 
the |location-list| is opened (users can redefine |CheckSyntaxFail()| to change 
this behaviour). You can use any |location-list| related command to navigate 
the list of syntax errors.

If vimscript #2584 is installed, lines containing syntax errors will be marked 
with signs.

By default, |:CheckSyntax| is mapped to <F5> (if not mapped already), 
and automatically executed when saving the buffer. The |:CheckSyntax| 
command takes one optional argument: the mode (default: &filetype).
<C-F5> will run all syntax checkers for a given filetype if multiple 
alternatives are defined and installed on your computer.

As the plugin doesn't provide syntax checks by its own. This is done by 
an external syntax checker that has to be installed on your computer.

For the following filetypes, syntax checkers are pre-defined:

    c, cpp :: Check syntax via splint
    html :: Check syntax via tidy
    javascript :: Check syntax via jslint, jshint, jsl, or gjslint
    java :: Check syntax via jlint or javaCheckstyle
    lua :: Parse file (luac -p)
    php  :: Check syntax (php -l)
    python :: Check file with pyflakes or pylint
    r :: Check syntax & style with lint::lint or svTools::lint
    ruby :: Check syntax (ruby -c)
    tex, latex :: Parse file (chktex -q -v0)
    xml, docbk :: Check syntax via xmllint

See the autoload/checksyntax/defs/ directory for a complete list of 
supported syntax checkers. See |g:checksyntax| also for how to define 
your own syntax checkers.

This plugin was originally based on Klaus Horsten's php_console 
(vimscript #779) and it is the successor of php_check_syntax.vim 
(vimscript #1272).
